# 01 - Project NEUTRALITY: Pandas, Data Wrangling, and Data Viz

In this homework, you will familiarize yourself with *Pandas*, the most popular Python library for handling tabular 
data. In addition, you will create some basic visualizations. These are among a data scientist's bread and 
butter -- perfect Homework 1 material!

The homework tasks are described in the `analysis.ipynb` notebook.

For each task, try to attempt *both* a written explanation of the steps you followed, and the corresponding code. 
Writing the explanation can help you in clarifying the steps in your mind before writing the actual code.

### Task
1. Complete `analysis.ipynb` notebook with disclosed output for each cell. **Please don't update the data folders provided in the repository, i.e., use it in read-only mode.**
